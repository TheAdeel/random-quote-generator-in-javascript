# random-quote-generator-in-javascript

It is a random quote generator app in javascript. We used public API form <a href="https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#get-random-quote">Quotable</a> to generate quotes randomly.
We used pure javascript no, library no framework was used. This is an open source app so you can freely download it and can do anything that you want.
